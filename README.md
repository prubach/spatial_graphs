Test Topoly with graph libraries to find K_3,3 or K_5 subgraphs


npm install cytoscape-cola
## Context path

The app is served at `/spatialgraph/` by default. Override with the `CONTEXT_PATH` env var (e.g. `CONTEXT_PATH=myapp python dash_graphs.py`); set it to an empty string to serve at `/`.

## Running with mod_wsgi-express

`wsgi.py` exposes the `application` object. Start it with the Dash prefix handling the context path (do not also pass `--mount-point`):

    mod_wsgi-express start-server wsgi.py --port 8014

The app is then available at `http://host:8014/spatialgraph/`.
